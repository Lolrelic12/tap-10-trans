The first offline event of Trash Again season 10 - Collection Day 2022 has officially begun accepting applications and promises to bring participants tons of fun. Now, let TAP tell you about the activities you shouldn't miss on Collection Day 2022!

Pangolin's journey to find her home through a series of activities on Collection Day 2022 consists of 3 main parts: PREPARATION - CELEBRATION - MOMENT.
Starting with the "Preparation" activity, participants will collect, clean, and furnish a home for Pangolin by gathering used materials.
After making thorough preparations, we will proceed to the main activity - CELEBRATION. TAP will exchange the scrap paper that you bring for high quality gift bags. If you can help the environment while also receiving special goodies, why hesitate to bring a lot of paper to Collection Day? 
Finally, Collection Day 2022 will end with the “Moment” activity. Let's save the momentous memories of the journey to find a home for Pangolin at the check-in photo booth that TAP has prepared to commemorate the companions on their way to find their own home. Trash Again believes that, through the series of exciting activities and careful preparation from the organizers of Collection Day 2022, you will have an unforgettable experience this summer. So, hurry up and fill out the application form to participate in Collection Day 2022 so that you won't miss anything from TAP house!

So what will be collected on Collection Day 2022? Firstly, scrap paper and old books is a guaranteed. Please collect scrap paper, or even books and notebooks that are no longer in use, pack them neatly and send them to Trash Again's event. Rest assured these materials will be recycled, processed and used in a beneficial way.


Not only that, but we at TAP also collects old plastic bottles and boxes.


In addition, on Collection Day 2022, Trash Again also accepts old and used batteries. Instead of throwing them away after use, which is both wasteful and harmful to the environment, you can bring them to TAP!


Finally, Trash Again also collects old clothes those are still in good condition. Most households probably have these. Nowadays, many families still have closets and wardrobes full of old clothes packed in a corner. If so, please gather your clothes, sort then pack them up, and Collection Day 2022 will take care of them for you!
