After nearly 4 weeks of accepting applications, the first event of Trash Again season 10 - "Trash Again Camp" took place exceptionally smoothly and successfully during its 2 days duration. Every facet of the event, from visuals and audio to the main acts and performances, was executed flawlessly. Despite our Campers initial bewilderment, the organizers still managed to create a buzzing atmosphere. With their guidance, the warm-up games were an absolute hit, and our guest speakers' stories became more gripping than ever.

The organizers of TAP Camp 2022 would like to extend profound thanks to our guest speakers and enthusiastic campers. We hope that everyone had had 2 memorable days camping with TAP. And if possible, don't forget to leave some comments and tell us how you feel after experiencing TAP Camp 2022!

TAP Camp has ended, but the journey of Trash Again season 10 is far from finished. Please continue following the page and look forward to seeing how our upcoming events will be even more exciting!
